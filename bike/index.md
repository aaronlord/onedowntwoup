My bike is a **Honda CBR 600 RR '05**. It was barely used when I purhcased it in 2011, having just a couple of hundred miles on the clock.
For a few years I commuted to work on it, went on weekend blasts and rode it to and from the handful of 'Road Bike Only' track days I attended.

After I no longer commuted to work and grew bored of road riding [the story began](/2016/01/04/lets-go-racing/).
