##### Helmet & Leathers
- AGV Pista GP Elements Limited
    - With the obligatory tinted visor, pinlock and tearoffs.
- Scott Leathers
    - 1 piece custom & made to measure. I had the monster logos put on because my previous helmet was an [Arai RX7-GP Cal Crutchlow WSBK Replica](https://media.cdnws.com/_i/38597/13494/3612/98/1450-rx-7gp-crutchlow-wsbk-p.jpeg).
- Dainese Rossi Replica Gloves
    - Don't know the model name. He wore years ago and featured on the [2009 Mugello helmet 'Hands'](http://rossihelmets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/rossi-mugello-2009-helmet.jpg).
- Dainese Axial Pro In Boots
    - Work in conjunction with Dainese suits and go under the leathers. I asked Scott Leathers to sew some velcro in my suit to make them work.
- Knox Aeigis Back Protector
- Knox Chest Protector
- Proskins baselayer


##### Consumables
- eBay special ear plugs

##### Electronics
- Garmin Virb Elite camera
    - This is what allows for funky video overlays. It pokes through a hole in the nose.
