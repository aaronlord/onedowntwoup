Here's a varied list of things optional things I’d recommend you buy, learn or do as soon as possible.

##### Suspension
There’s a reason there’s a suspension specialist at pretty much every track day. As stock, motorbikes are hilariously generic and soft, so, go see the suspension specialist at the track as soon as possible.

In exchange for a few quid, he (or she) will perform some black magic voodoo shit on your bike in the form of twisting some knobs on your forks and shock. After which, you’ll have new bike. Seriously - a new bike.

If you’re serious about attending more track days and considering dropping a small fortune on performance upgrades, I’d highly recommend upgrading your suspension before adding more useless power in the form of an exhaust/power commander/etc.

##### Tyre warmers
You’ve paid a lot of money to attend a track day. Say you get 7 * 20 minute sessions . If it’s 2 minutes a lap and you spend 3 laps warming your tyres up, you’re wasting 1/4 of your session and day pootling around with your ass hole twitching like a rabbits nose.

£100 on some tyre warmers and they’ve paid for themselves in 4 track days. Not to mention the confidence and safety net they give you right out the gate.

##### Camera
Nobody cares about what you’re filming. Anything more than a lap or two is boring to watch for anyone other than yourself.

So, use your camera as a tool. Point it at what you’re working on for review later. Your lines, your body position, foot position, throttle, whatever.

##### Clutchless upshifts
Stop using the clutch on upshifts. It doesn’t damage the bike, and, one could argue that using the clutch does more “damage”.

On the throttle, put a bit of pressure on the peg with your foot and roll off the throttle relatively quickly. It’ll change gear and you can get back on the throttle.

With practice, you’ll figure out how much and how quickly to roll off to get it to shift and they’ll get smoother and smoother.

The only exception is when changing to 1st to 2nd, when it’s acceptable to speed shift instead.

Speed shifting is when you feather the clutch slightly between the shift. Lots of people do this for every gear instead of doing it clutchless, which, to reiterate is just adding unnecessary wear to the clutch.

##### You and your bike
Get a good night's sleep the day before and be sure to eat and drink on the day. Needing a piss after every session is a million times better than the inevitable cramp you’ll suffer.

Remove or tape up your mirrors and brake light at a minimum. They’re distractions to you and others around you.

Check your bikes oil, coolant, brakes, tyres, etc. Take spares of what you can.

If possible, take fuel in a container and run with as little in your bike as you dare. People spend small fortunes on their bike to make them lighter - then ride around with a full tank of fuel.

That’ll be something like 15kg of unnecessary weight high up on the bike. Your bike will accelerate, brake and turn faster with less effort. Even if you’re not setting blistering lap times, the weight loss will fatigue you less and might even save your ass if you panic brake.
