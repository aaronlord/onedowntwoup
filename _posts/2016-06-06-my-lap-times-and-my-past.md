The original purpose of this post was to simply point you to the new [lap times page](/lap-times), however, I figured I should take the opportunity to fill you in on what happened before I started this website.

### Pre 2016

My first on track experience was at the Ron Haslam Race School back in 2012. I didn’t know anyone who went on track days at the time, so I didn’t have a yardstick and wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to make a fool of myself.

It turned out to be a good idea, because to be honest, I hated my first time out on the track. I felt rushed, uncomfortable and clumsy. I explained this to my instructor and we set about fixing my problems. The rest, as they say, is history.

I attended 4 road bike only track days in the following 3 years - riding my street bike to the track, doing the track day and then riding home.

Interestingly - excluding my first to second track day - I didn’t improve.

Why? Probably because I made the rookie mistake of solely focusing on getting my knee down instead of getting faster. I tied myself up in all sorts of knots and confused the feeling of going faster with feeling uncomfortable. I didn't get my knee down.

### 2016 onward

In 2016 I decided I wanted to [go racing](/2016/01/04/lets-go-racing), converted my bike into a track bike and bought a van.

At the time I was still wobbling around in the novice group, so publicly stating that as a goal was my way of really committing to it. 

Clearly I wasn’t improving by riding round and round, hoping I’d chance upon some skill. I had to take a step back, look at my riding, ask questions and set goals. Why am I slow around that corner? The bike feels unstable. Am I gripping the bars too tightly? Yes, definitely. Can I lock into the bike better? And so on.

That, ladies and gentlemen, brings us to the present. I’m still questioning myself, trying to figure out this business of going fast and so far it’s going really well.

Writing about it in this blog is a massive motivation to keep pressing on, and I hope that you’re enjoying reading about it too - maybe even improving for yourself as a result.

Thanks for reading and your support.
